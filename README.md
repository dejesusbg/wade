# Wade v2

Context-aware macOS menu-bar assistant that decides *on its own* when help is warranted,
using J-space engagement in a local model as the trigger. See `CLAUDE.md` for the full brief.

```
app/       SwiftUI menu-bar app (SwiftPM).
             WadeIPC   wire protocol + reconnecting UDS client
             WadeCore  memory stores (SQLite), integrations catalog, event detectors
             Wade      menu bar, onboarding, settings, AX/NSWorkspace observation
backend/   Python interpretability core (uv project). Currently: UDS server that logs events.
```

## Status: Phase 1 (SwiftUI shell), done pending manual AX check

### Run it

```sh
# Terminal 1: backend (owns the socket)
cd backend && uv sync && uv run wade-backend

# Terminal 2: build + launch the signed app bundle (needed for the Accessibility grant)
cd app && scripts/bundle.sh && open build/Wade.app
```

Tests: `cd app && swift test` (14) and `cd backend && uv run pytest` (3).
Headless IPC check: `cd app && swift build && .build/debug/wade-ipc-check`.

Menu bar glyph: dashed = not observing (backend down, setup unfinished, or no Accessibility
access); circle = observing; filled = a trigger arrived.

Socket: `~/Library/Application Support/Wade/wade.sock` (mode 0600), overridable on both
sides with `WADE_SOCKET_PATH`. Either process can start first; the app reconnects every 2s.
Memory: `~/Library/Application Support/Wade/memory.sqlite`.

### What Phase 1 observes

Nothing is observed until onboarding is finished **and** Accessibility is granted. Revoking
access in System Settings stops observation within about a second.

| `event_type` | Source | Metadata |
|---|---|---|
| `focus_change` | app activation / AX focused-window change (300ms settle); focused-window title change only once stable for 2s, so title spinners and progress counters don't read as context switches; deduped | `cause` |
| `error_dialog` | a sheet/dialog with error-like text (EN+ES keywords), found on window creation, focus change, or app activation; each dialog is reported once, while a new dialog with the same text counts as a recurrence | `signature` (16-hex hash, digits masked), `role` |
| `keypress_burst` | global keyDown monitor → typing runs (gap 2s, ≥5 keys), closed on focus change | `key_count`, `duration_s`, `started_at` |
| `undo` | global keyDown monitor, ⌘Z | none |
| `idle_start` / `idle_end` | `CGEventSource` seconds-since-any-input, 30s threshold | `idle_seconds` (end) |

Privacy: key contents are never stored or sent (only counts and a ⌘Z flag), and dialog text
is reduced to a hash. Wade's own windows are excluded.

Known gaps, kept on purpose for v1:
- In-window error UI that isn't a dialog (e.g. Xcode's "Build Failed" banner) is not detected.
  Revisit if Phase 7 shows it matters.
- No global hotkey (dropped for v1), so no Input Monitoring permission is needed.
  Accessibility alone covers the key monitor.

### Signing

`scripts/bundle.sh` signs with the first **Apple Development** certificate in your keychain
(or `$WADE_SIGN_IDENTITY`). macOS then ties the Accessibility grant to "this bundle id,
signed by this developer", which survives rebuilds and can't be claimed by other apps.

Without a certificate it falls back to ad-hoc signing, with the requirement pinned to
`identifier "com.ricardo.wade"` only. That also survives rebuilds (verified), but any locally
built app claiming that id would inherit Wade's Accessibility access. It's fine for bootstrapping.

Get a certificate once: Xcode → Settings → Accounts → your Apple ID → Manage Certificates…
→ **+** → Apple Development. Then rebuild. macOS will ask for Accessibility once more,
because the signature changed. Remove the old "Wade" entry in System Settings → Privacy &
Security → Accessibility and grant the new one.

### Manual checks

`scripts/dialog-probe.sh` pops up two clearly labeled *fake* error alerts for about 11s. With
Wade running, expect exactly two `error_dialog` events from `com.wade.dialog-probe` with
equal signatures.

### Memory stores (§5.7)

One SQLite file, separate tables: `onboarding_facts` + `integration_opt_ins` (user-stated,
editable in Settings → About You) and `correction_facts` (provenance-tagged, shown in
Settings → Corrections, empty until Phase 6 writes to it). Explicit feedback only.

### Protocol

Newline-delimited JSON over `AF_UNIX`, shapes exactly as in CLAUDE.md §5.2
(`tkg_event` Swift→Py, `trigger_fired` Py→Swift), plus a `ping`/`pong` liveness pair.
Source of truth: `backend/src/wade_backend/protocol.py` ↔ `app/Sources/WadeIPC/Messages.swift`.

Deliberate choices:
- Events sent while disconnected are **dropped, not queued**. A stale TKG backlog
  replayed on reconnect would feed the gate a false burst.
- Malformed lines are logged and skipped. They never drop the connection.
- `metadata` values are scalar JSON (string/int/double/bool).

### Legacy inventory (§3)

- `src-tauri/src/lib.rs`: `WadePacket {type: "message"|"action", data, skill?, arguments?}`
  over HTTP POST to `127.0.0.1:9090`. `rdev` Alt+Space executes the *pending* action, and
  the same `rdev` listener streams every mouse move to the overlay. Carried forward: typed,
  `type`-tagged JSON messages. Dropped: the TCP port and the global mouse tap.
- `OverlayWindow.tsx` / `Wade.tsx`: full-screen transparent click-through window with
  spring physics chasing the cursor, and a 15s auto-dismiss. `useTextStream` fakes streaming
  by revealing a finished string at 30–60ms/char. All dropped (§5.1, §5.5).
- `skills/*/manifest.json`: `{name, version, description, main, arguments: [string]}`.
  `arguments` is untyped names only, so an MCP `inputSchema` is a strict upgrade.
  `utils.py` = env loading + packet send + a hardcoded Gemini call. Skills report back by
  POSTing to the app, which is the kind of back-channel the UDS design removes.
- Ignored per brief: `backend/` (Neo4j/vector-DB services), `docker-compose.yml`.
